# IMDB Clone - Movie Management Web App
IMDB Clone is a dynamic web application that harnesses the power of vanilla JavaScript to provide users with a seamless and efficient browsing experience.
The core functionality of the app centers around its capability to search for movies using the OMDB API.
By querying the API, the application retrieves a wealth of data about the requested movie, including key details such as its title, release year, and other pertinent information. 
This data is then thoughtfully presented in a user-friendly format, enabling users to swiftly access the precise movie details they desire.

# Usage
